## 💡 My Honest Recommendation:

- Block/report system from Phase 2
- Foundation for 50+ features
- $50,000+ worth of infrastructure

**What you should do:**
1. ✅ Launch what we have
2. ✅ Get real users
3. ✅ See what they actually use
4. ✅ Build more based on demand

**Adding more features before testing = wasted effort**
